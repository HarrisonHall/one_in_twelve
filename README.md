# 1 in 12 people live near an active or potentially active volcano
... or do they? Maybe. Maybe not. So I have this National Geographic book called
"Vocano: Iceland's Inferno" which makes the (probably well researched) claim that
"About 1 in 12 of the world's population live around Earth's active or potentially
active volcanoes." While this statement is a great icebreaker, is it true? Probably. 
And my script agrees.

This is all assuming that the "scientific" statement "near" means in the danger zone
of an active or potentially active volcano, which I assumed to be a 50 mile radius. 

## Data
All of my city location/population data can be found at [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)
and all of my volcano data was grabbed from [OSU's Volcano World](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/volcano_table),
but a file has been provided anyway. 

Is the data good? I don't doubt the information, but the sample size is very low. 
Only about 30% of the world's population is located in free csv I downloaded containing 
~13000 cities. Also, only ~450 volcanoes are included in the file while I believe about
1500 have been found on land.

## Conclusion
I don't know, I'm not a volcanologist. Output has been provided in the `output.txt` file.
A sample is below.

6.805617106265969 % of people live near an active or potentially active volcano
```

So... Is 6.8% about 1 in 12? I guess 6.8% and 8.3% are pretty close. But really 
6.8% is closer to 1 in 15. But the real question is, do *you* live near an 
active or potentially active volcano?
